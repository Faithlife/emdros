README for Emdros Perl bindings
-------------------------------

From: Chris Wilson <emdros@qwirx.com>
Date: 24-Feb-2003

Current status:
	* Readiness:     EXPERIMENTAL, needs testing
	* Completeness:  fairly COMPLETE (no known omissions)
	* Documentation: UNDOCUMENTED (but see test.pl for code samples)
	* Stability:     UNSTABLE, known memory leaks

This interface will probably change, as the changes listed in the TODO
section are implemented.

What works
----------
- connect to database
- Use the CEMdFDB interface
- Create a EMdFOutput object
- Create a MQLExecEnv object
- Execute MQL queries
- Determine whether the query succeeded or failed, and whether the result
  is a table or sheaf
- For tables, retrieve the contents of the table one cell at a time,
  and the whole table into a 2D array reference
- For sheaves, retrieve an array of straws (Emdros::Straw objects)
- For straws,  retrieve an array of matched objects (Emdros::MatchedObject)
- For matched objects, retrieve properties and the embedded sheaf

What doesn't work
-----------------
- Nothing known to be missing at this time, but:
- Everything not listed above is untested, and
- Your mileage may vary.

TODO
----

- Some accessor methods will become member methods
- A bug in SWIG needs to be fixed so that some shadow methods such as
  Emdros::Straw_to_array become usable (in the meantime use their
  equivalents from the Emdrosc:: package instead)
- New classes may be created to provide more Perl-friendly interfaces
  than C++ iterators
- The test script (test.pl) will not rely on the presence of a "wihebrew"
  database
- The whole interface should become generic and not Perl-specific,
  sharing as much code as possible with the Ruby bindings, designed to
  facilitate creation of new bindings
- Dependence on MySQL will be removed

Installation
------------
Compilation and installation are NOT integrated with the rest of Emdros
at this time. SWIG is required to build. MySQL server, libraries and headers 
are required, as is the wihebrew database. Only Linux is tested.

To install the libraries, run the following commands as indicated by the
lines starting with "unix#".

unix# cd emdros-1.1.x/SWIG/perl
unix# make -f Makefile.swig
unix# perl Makefile.PL
unix# make
unix# make test
...
All tests finished OK!
unix# make install

Usage
-----
See the file 'test.pl' for examples of all currently supported features
and how to use them.
