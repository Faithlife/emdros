How to build the Node.JS Emdros SWIG bindings
---------------------------------------------

First, if you are building after "make distclean", or otherwise don't
have the file:

emdrosnode_wrap.cxx

in the SWIG/nodejs/ directory, you'll need SWIG version 3.0.7 or later
installed.


Second, you need node, npm, and node-gyp

$ sudo npm install -g node-gyp


Third, you need to run this:

$ node-gyp install

This installes the development files for your version of node.


Fourth, compile Emdros on your target platform, as detailed in either:

- INSTALL (for Linux)
- INSTALL.Mac.txt (for Mac OS X)

Sadly, we don't have support for building on Windows yet.  Feel free
to inquire of the author (see AUTHORS) if you need Windows support for
Node.


How to use
----------

See test.js for some hints.


Enjoy!
