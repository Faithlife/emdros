INSTALLING Emdros on Win32 platforms
====================================


Prebuilt binaries
-----------------

If you are using a version of Emdros for which binaries have been
released, it is easiest to use them.  If no binaries are provided, you
will have to compile Emdros yourself.


PostgreSQL notes
----------------

Please note that PostgreSQL version 8.0 is required on Win32.

Please also note that libpq.dll is no longer needed.


MySQL notes
-----------

Please note that the MySQL version requires the file libmysql.dll to
be present either in the current path or in the same location as the
Emdros programs.  This file can be found in the distribution of MySQL,
and is not distributed with Emdros.  Look for it in

%MYSQLPREFIX%\lib\opt

where "%MYSQLPREFIX%" is usually something like

"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 4.1"

or the like.


Emdros (not) on Cygwin
----------------------

As of 1.1.8, Emdros does not support compiling under cygwin.


Compiling with Visual C++
-------------------------

Go to the win32 directory and read the README.txt file for
instructions on how to compile.


Post-installation docs
----------------------

After installation, please read the doc/HOW-TO-USE file.

Please also see the other documentation in the doc/ directory.
