Introduction
============

Emdros works great on Android.

Basically, you have two choices:

1) Use the SWIG Java bindings, and access Emdros via the JNI API
   provided through those bindings.

2) Write a C++ wrapper around Emdros, and link that against the Emdros
   amalgamation.  Then provide a JNI interface to your C++ wrapper,
   and call that from the Java layer of Android.
