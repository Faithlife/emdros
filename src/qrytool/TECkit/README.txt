This directory holds the TECkit encoding conversion kit from SIL
International.  It is a version which I have modified.

SIL make it available under the disjunction of the CPL and the LGPL.
Since the CPL is incompatible with the GPL (see the homepage of the
Free Software Foundation), if you choose to link TECkit against Emdros
(which is under the GPL), you must opt for using the LGPL.

The TECkit homepage can be found here:
